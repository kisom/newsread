newsread
--------

this is a bit of python that uses NLP to find news stories i might find
interesting and sends them to me.

research areas:    
    * analyzing / quantifying a story    
    * factoring linguistic modality    

dependencies:
    * python-feedparser
    * sqlite3 (will likely switch to postgres later on)
